# React Redux reducer+selector
The Intention of this task is to know and understand:

* The purpose of a reducer and the role it plays within your application
* Why a reducer should stay as pure as possible
* Why mutations should not happen within a reducer
* The use of Immutable within the reducer
* The use of Normalizr within the app
* ```Selectors```: what they are and when to use them
